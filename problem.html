      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <h3>Worldwide consumption and production — a driving force of the global economy — rest on the use of the natural
        environment and resources in a way that continues to have destructive impacts on the planet.
        <br> <br>
        Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is
        endangering the very systems on which our future development — indeed, our very survival — depends. <a href="sources.html">[8]</a> </h3>
      <ul class="text-facts">
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>•Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes worth around $1
            trillion –
            ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and
            harvesting practices. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>•If people worldwide switched to energy efficient light bulbs the world would save US$120 billion
            annually. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be
            required to
            provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. <a href="sources.html">[8]</a></li>

        While it looks like the world cannot stop consuming goods, there is some hope in the end of the tunnel.

        Today's online and physical stores often contains a broad product selection, and that is a good thing.
        However, many of the production patterns to the products that are sold are often harmful to the environment’s wellbeing.
        Blinded mass production has contributed to many problems like climate change, massive deforestation, multiple
        species
        dying out and a process called ocean acidification.(source1). <br><br>
        In recent years many have come to the realization that if we don’t change our consumption, we eventually
        will end up destroying our livelihood.<br>

      <h2>How our app will help</h2>
      
      <ul class="text-facts">
        <ul>
          <li>• We have created an app that list all the available environmentally friendly wares to the user and gives
            options depinding on the users needs.
            This includes food, technology, clothes, and more.
          </li>

          <li>• The app will ensure users that the product they are reading about is environnmentally friendly. This can
            be guraanteed as the team
            regularly research the sources of product in the various stores and resturants.
          </li>

          <li>• Sometimes, having an eco-label does not automatically mean that the product is environmentally
            friendly<a href="sources.html"> [9]</a>. However, with the help of recommendations from the norwegian consumer council [source], we conduct our own research 
            to be safe that what you are shown is guaranteed to be eco-friendly.
          </li>
        
          <li>•The app encourages companies to adopt sustainable practices and to 
            integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle. </li>
