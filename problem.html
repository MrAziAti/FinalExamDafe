        <h2>Our Consumption challenge</h2>
        <p>
          We have chosen UN development goal 12 to be our problem to help solve. This goal focuses on sustainable consumption and production. Some of the goals include
  
      

        <p>Todays everyday supermarket often contains a lot of different varieties of food. And that is a good thing, however many of the products that are sold are often harmful to the environment’s wellbeing.
           Blinded mass production has lead to many problems like climate change, massive deforestation, multiple species dying out and a process called ocean acidification.<br>
           In recent years many have come to the realization that if we don’t change our consumption that we eventually will end up destroying both animal and human conditions.<br>
           Therefor many have chosen to rather consume products that are more environmentally friendly and ethical like “svanemerket” or “GOTS”.<br>

  <h2> Doubts</h2>
  <p>Since ecological food became available to the public there has been some negative criticism towards it.<br>
   There have been discussions about whether ecological food is environmentally friendly at all.<br>
    Ecological farming requires a larger area to produce the same amount of food<br> and may actually produce more methane than non-ecological production. (Refereanse1)<br>
     So it has become difficult for consumers to be confident that the food they buy is actually better for the environment.<br> This is something we want to adress in our app.
     Ensuring people that what they get are from realiable sources</p>
