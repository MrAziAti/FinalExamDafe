      <h2>Our Consumption challenge</h2>
      <p>
        We have chosen UN development goal 12 to be our problem to help solve. This goal focuses on sustainable
        consumption and production. Some of the goals include
        Todays everyday supermarket often contains a lot of different varieties of food. And that is a good thing,
        however many of the products that are sold are often harmful to the environment’s wellbeing.
        Blinded mass production has lead to many problems like climate change, massive deforestation, multiple species
        dying out and a process called ocean acidification.<br><br>
        In recent years many have come to the realization that if we don’t change our consumption that we eventually
        will end up destroying both animal and human conditions.<br>
        Therefor many have chosen to rather consume products that are more environmentally friendly and ethical like
        “svanemerket” or “GOTS”.<br><br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4> Some of the goals we want to tackle:</h4>
      <br>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>-Achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throught their lifecycle</li>
          <li>-Present public procurment practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national polities and priorities</li>
          <li>-Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns</li><br>
          <li>-Help prevent the degredation of enviormantal resources</li>
        </ul>

      <h2> Doubts</h2>
      <p>Since ecological food and clothes became available to the public there has been some negative criticism towards it.
        There have been discussions about whether ecological food is environmentally friendly at all. 
        Ecological farming requires a larger area to produce the same amount of food and may actually produce more
        methane than non-ecological production. (<a href="sources.html">Source [1])</a></a></a><br><br>
        So it has become difficult for consumers to be confident that the food they buy is actually better for the
        environment. This is something we want to adress in our app.
        Ensuring people that what they get are from realiable sources.
        in Addition one of the problems we often see is that products with eco-labels are more expensive than non-sustainable 
        products which often results in those type of products becoming less accesible to people on a budget.
        This leads us to our solution. We have developed an app that will show you sustainable products for a
        reasoable price. This will hopefully help consumers choose a more sustainble product.
