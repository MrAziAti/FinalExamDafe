         <h2>The solution</h2>
         <p>"Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
            generations to meet their needs. The concept of sustainability is composed of three pillars: economic,
            environmental, and social-also known informally as profits, planet, and people."
