      <h2>The solution</h2>
      <p>"Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
        generations to meet their needs. The concept of sustainability is composed of three pillars: economic,
        environmental, and social-also known informally as profits, planet, and people."- Mitchell Grant.
        -Making a sustainable choice has never been easier.
